# Logistic-Regression-LDA

For this section we will be using a beginner friendly dataset to test a simple binary classification task of whether a person will
be interested in learning a new sport based on just two attributes namely, age and interest quotient, that can be downloaded
from Kaggle. With respect to this dataset, implement/report the following:
1. Plot the dataset using different colors for the two classes. [5 Marks]
2. Implement the least square method for classification and plot the decision boundary. Clearly describe your results. Is the decision boundary able to classify the points correctly? [15 Marks]
3. Implement the logistic regression using gradient descent method. Choose the initial values of w in the range [âˆ’0.1, 0.1]. Plot a 3D figure depicting the sigmoid function obtained along with the same color coding of the points. Did the performance improved as compared to previous question? [15 Marks]
4. Plot the decision boundary obtained for logistic regression. [5 Marks]
5. Find the linear discriminant boundary and describe your results. [10 Marks]
6. Logistic regression considers only linear decision boundaries. One way to go from linear decision boundaries to non-linear decision boundaries is by considering polynomial curve of higher degree. For example, if input attributes are x1, x2 then transforming it into 2 degree polynomial will give features: {x1, x2, x21, x22, x1x2, 1}. Identify an appropriate degree of the transformation that results in the optimal performance via logistic regression. Clearly explain your choice. [10 Marks]
7. Above expansion will result in non-linear decision boundary. Plot the boundary along with the dataset points. [5 Marks]
